                    <h1>Why LG left the Phone Market?</h1>
                    <p>The reason why LG decides to quit the market because they faced loss over several
                        billion dollars in Mobile Industry.<br>Here are some of the reasons for their loss:<br><br><br>
                        1. Pricing( they are not pricing competitively)<br><br>
                        2. Innovation (They are actually super excellent but they are innovating something for
                        each and every mobile<br>and not considering the innovation of
                        previous Mobile,so developers also can't work well for that
                        single Mobile)<br><br>
                        3. Updates ( updates are usually slow from their track records)<br><br>
                        4.Naming ( There is a big confusion in naming smartphone nowadays
                        and LG is first of all ,<br>they will just name their smartphone with
                        unusual order and very rare name which people can easily forget).<br><br>
                        5.Another reason behind LG's failure is that it simply wasn't memorable enough to users<br><br>
                        6.LG's then-flagship phone in 2015, the G4, had bootloop issues, a problem with the hardware that causes a phone to go into a never-ending reboot cycle.<br><br>
